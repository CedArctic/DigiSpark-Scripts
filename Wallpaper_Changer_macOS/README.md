# macOS Wallpaper Changer

This script launches Spotlight to launch Terminal.app in order to download a picture, and sets it as a wallpaper, in less than 3 seconds.

Feel free to change the image link in the script in order to set another image.

Changing the download path (/Users/Shared/wallpaper.jpg) may crash the AppleScript executed to change the wallpaper.
